# Wallpaper App
NOTE: This app won't do anything, because the code that gets the images isn't included (See below)

Made in under 24 hours so the code is bad.

## Requirements
Unity 6000
Android build support (iOS not supported)
Implement API

## API
Free image API's (very understanably) do not allow them to be used to make a competing service, like a wallpaper app.
I've not included any code that would break a platform's Terms of Service. This means that the app won't actually do anything lol.
You'll have to implement the API interface yourself. Good luck!
